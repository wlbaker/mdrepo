[RUBAL] Here are some suggestions for futures for Sigma-PAD (not in a priority order)

1)	Display step information in parameter boxes, to prevent confusion as to what step you are on.
2)	Zero line for scales (on/off)
[FIXED 040217] 3)	Using time select box lower right corner, y-axis rescales nice if it were on the last y-scale.
4)	Handling PVC beats in Ensemble average routines and waterfall plots. 
5)	Need for <.25 Hz low pass (or100-250 center  point mean sample) filter… Objective… from pulsatile mean but able to show step up in PCWP recordings. Would be nice to see low pass filter with respiratory  some respiratory variability and even nicer if overlay on raw pulsatile signal. 
DONE 062817    6)	Piecewise bias and gain adjustments
7)	Export raw and altered e.g. derivative, difference etc. waveforms
8)	When adding a new annotation that is and annotation B2B table does not identify label for annotation
9)	Using cursor on view, either lock on to waveform and see moving dot or a vertical line moving 
10)	The view “Annotation” table only indicates xy values for time of  R-spike, would like to see “Annotation” tables for each layer…. … e.g. LVEDP that would show R spike info and beat sequence plus time for LVEDP and Y value.  (This example already goes to B2B, but other xy values for layers do not.
11)        Mirror the left heart measures for equivalent right heart measures. E.g  layer for RVEDP, RVPs, PAPs,d,m... etc...
12)        Option for trend over time plots (any Y (or derived Y) parameter.
[13 WLB] Don't allow layers of the same name!
14) Side-by-side plots: Standard monitor + trends+waterfall and Phase Space
15) Dropping the same Feature layer on a graph twice will result in duplicate/overlapping feature layers!

DONE 062817	: --> particularly important when exporting a single beat
