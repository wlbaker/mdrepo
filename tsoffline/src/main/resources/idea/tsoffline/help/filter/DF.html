A difference filter, with a transpose, inverse, and inverse-transpose. 
A 1-D difference filter is an approximation to a backward-difference filter: 
y[i] = x[i]-0.999*x[i-1]. The constant 0.999 is less than one so that the 
recursive inverse filter $$y_i = x_i+0.999*y_{i-1}$$ is stable. The inverse 
filter is sometimes called \"leaky integration\", and is especially useful 
for preconditioning inverse problems with smooth solutions.
<p>
Sequential application of the backward-difference filter and its transpose 
yields an approximation to a negative centered 2nd-difference filter: 
y[i] = -x[i-1]+2*x[i]-x[i+1].
<p>
Extensions to 2-D and 3-D backward-difference filters are defined as in 
Claerbout, J., 1998, Multidimensional recursive filters via a helix: 
Geophysics, v. 63, n. 5, p. 1532-1541.
<p>
These extensions were obtained here by factoring the negative centered 
2-D and 3-D 2nd-difference filters, respectively, using the Wilson-Burg 
algorithm, as in Fomel, S., Sava, P., Rickett, J., and Claerbout, J., 2003, 
The Wilson-Burg method of spectral factorization with application to helical 
filtering: Geophysical Prospecting, v. 51, p. 409-420.
<p>
For all dimensions, these approximations yield less than one percent error
in the negative centered 2nd-difference filter, relative to the exact central
filter coefficient. For example, the error for a 2-D filter is less than
0.04 = 0.01*4, where 4 is the central coefficient in the exact negative
2nd-difference filter.
