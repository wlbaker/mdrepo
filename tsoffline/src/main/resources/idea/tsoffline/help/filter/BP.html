A multi-dimensional band-pass filter. Filtering is performed using fast Fourier transforms.
The result is equivalent to convolution with an ideal symmetric (zero-phase) band-pass filter
that has been smoothly tapered to zero.
<p>
Filter parameters include lower and upper frequencies that define the pass band, the width
of the transition from pass band to stop bands, and the maximum error for amplitude in both
pass and stop bands.
<p>
For efficiency the Fourier transform of the filter may be cached for repeated application to
multiple input arrays. A cached transform can be reused while the lengths of input and output
arrays do not change. Because caching consumes memory, it is disabled by default.
