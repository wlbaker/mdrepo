Construct a Butterworth filter with specified parameters. The filter is
specified by amplitudes at two frequencies. The frequencies are in normalized
units of cycles/sample. Either a low-pass or high-pass filter is constructed,
depending on which of the corresponding two amplitudes is smaller. The filter
is designed to match the larger (pass band) amplitude exactly, but may have
amplitude lower than the smaller (reject band) amplitude.
