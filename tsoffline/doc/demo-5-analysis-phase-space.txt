Hello, my name is Bill Baker.  Welcome to our continuation of tutorials on tsOffline, 
the analysis software developed at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research.

--

In this demo, we will look at the phase space representation of a simple cardiac pressure 
signal.  Phase space images capture state as well as configuration and can elucidate 
qualities of a system that might not otherwise be obvious.
  
We will be continuing our analysis of Active Duty Normal soldiers from the 
Hemodynamic Waveform Library of the Cardiology Service at Brooke Army Medical Center.  
If you are following our videos, you can open our data file from the recently opened
list of files.  Select File/BAMC 0049 tutorial 2.

At this point, it is not necessary to understand the details of phase space in order
to appreciate its use as a novel method of cardiac waveform analysis.
So lets jump right into the analysis.

---------

In this phase space analysis, we will be looking closely at the Left distal, Left proxal,
and ECG waveforms and we will be comparing their phase space representations to 
the simple waveform image.
Select a range of data near the beginning of our ECG segmentation and zoom in
to inspect the waveforms.  

Select Run/Analysis, PHASE-5pt-smooth-video then Next.  
This analysis will covern an extended time range, so select "Time Range".  For
the Start, enter the initial time from the display, 12:42:00.  The Stop time
defaults to the end of our data file, which works well for our purpose.  
Select Next, L dist, and Next again.  We will accept the default script, and 
press Next.

##   

[# press 0!]
Resize the window as needed, and press the green "play" arrow at the 
bottom of the screen.  The top screen displays a phase space 
representation for Left Ventricular pressure.  The bottom illustrates 
left ventricular pressure recording.  In the phase diagram, the X axis 
is the pressure measurement and the  axis is the first derivative of 
the pressure signal.  The most recent data is drawn in white.  And the 
lines fade to black over a 30-second interval.

Several Premature ventricular beats may be seen both on the phase space display and in the time domain.  

Press the + key twice to zoom in on the actual waveform, then press the Pause
button.

From the phase space image, we see the pressure oscillates between a low 
pressure close to zero mmHg, and high pressure slightly over 100 mmHg.  Let's slow 
down the visualization to 1/10th real time, press Play, and observe that
the indicator moves around in a clockwise path around the figure.

## This record also shows the result of zeroing and calibrating the catheter during the original recording sequence. 

Press Pause again.

This somewhat stable figure is called an attractor, and it has several
prominent features.  It is not completely symmetric.  The upper half is flatter than
the lower half.  This indicatives the pressure inside the ventricle rises
more slowly than it falls.  The lower half is also separable into two segments with
different slopes.  With close inspection of the L dist pressure waveform, one can
see an inflection point at approximately 60 mm Hg.  This is the source of the
discontinuity in the lower half of the image.

We can conclude that small features of this signal are more easily observed
in the phase space representation than by direct inspection of the waveform. 
The phase diagram for left ventricular pressure provides quantitative information 
about contractile and diastolic properties of the heart as well as ventricular 
vascular coupling. 

---------

We can look at other waveforms in the same way.  Press Previous twice, select ECG, and press
Next twice, [# press 0!] and press Play.

In this video, we see a stable attractor with occasional perturbations due to
Ectopic beats.  The shape of this attractor will change with placement of ECG leads
as well as changes to the patient condition.  
##Hemodynamic stability is directly observable in the attractor.  
Stresses such as hypo or hypervolemia 
also manifest themselves in the attractors, as well as
more intrinsic indicators of cardiac condition.  

Although the ECG signal is feature rich, it is also a very repetitive signal
and easily observed with this method.

For less stable signals, some modifications may be needed.  
We will use the Aortic pressure waveform for this example.  
Press Pause, Previous
and select L proxal.  Now click Next, twice.  Press C to center the Left
Proxal center in the display.  [#Press 0!] From simple observation, this
signal is clearly less stable than the others that we have observed.  
Press Play and notice that it is difficult to see the signal structure 
in this attractor.  

The derivative in the phase space which we have chosen
is too sensitive for this signal, however, we can modify
this script to show a more useful phase space which is less sensitive
to noise and small changes.  Our new phase space will consist of the same
pressure signal in the X coordinate, but the
Y coordinate will be a time-shifted value of the X coordinate.

To make this change, press Pause & Previous.  
Three lines of code will be changed to create a lag in the signal to 
improve the phase space display.  
Create a variable "lag", and assign a value of 30, which corresponds 
to 60 ms for our 500 hz signal.  Our X value must go from (lag+1) to n.  
And the corresponding y values will then go from 1 to n-lag.

This accomplishes our objective: two arrays of equal length, an array of X 
values and an array of Y values, that differ in time by 60ms.

Press Next, and Play.  Zoom in on the attractor as desired by pressing the
right mouse button while dragging the mouse.  Now we can observe a much 
more well-formed attractor.

---------


Meaningful non-random signals always have a visually interesting phase space
representation, though some filtering and experimentation may be necessary to see it.

# This analysis view could be extended in several ways, such as removal
# of respiratory variability from the signal to give
# a much cleaner attractor for the Left proxal sensor or 
# adding a centroid of the figure, and  track it over a time
# to provide long term indication of hemodynamic status and trends.

This concludes our phase space analysis tutorial.
