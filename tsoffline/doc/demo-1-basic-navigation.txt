Hello, my name is Bill Baker and I'd like to introduce you to some software for 
offline data analysis that was developed at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research.

The data which we will be viewing today is a subset of the data collected from
the cardiology department of Brooke Army Medical Center in the 1970's. The data was
originally recorded on 1-inch tape, and more recently, digitized and stored on disk.  
The data was collected using invasive cardiac catheters from active duty service members
who were being evaluated for possible cardiac conditions.  These individuals were
determined to be Normal.

This is a rather special set of data.  These were young healthy males and today this
procedure would be considered beyond nominal and minimal risk for a healthy
subject, and as such it would be difficult if not impossible to capture this data today. 
Data is captured in a very similar manner today, as part of the normal 
clinical procedure being conducted on patients with existing cardiac conditions.

Let's jump into the data.

--------------

To begin with, let's open a data file as if this is the first time to do so.  We 
will be opening a local data file, as opposed to remote file or a study.  Local 
data files are located on a local workstation disk or a shared server drive.  A 
remote file would not be available locally and requires download from a remote 
repository.  Study files are similar to remote files.  This data is extracted 
directly from a data collection device known as the IDEA server.  Only the local 
file feature will be discussed in 
this video.  Select "local file" and "Next" at the bottom of the screen.

-------

We see data files for several patients here.  Each folder represents a data 
collection session for a single subject, and is further identified by the data 
source, subject number, and minimal demographic information.  The method of 
organization and names of the files in the local file system is entirely at
 the discretion of the 
researcher. In this data, we see that data files are available for a 34 year 
old male, a 20 year old male, a 38 year old male, and several others.  Let's start 
with the first data folder which is identified as BAMC subject 0049 Normal,
a 34 year old male.

There are several types of data files that we can open.  Our primary data files
are DAT files, H5 files. We can also open session files of previously saved data.
These session files contain additional information such as annotations, 
calibration information and analysis results.

Lets open a data file as if it is the first time to do it.  For that, we will open
the DAT file.  Select the DAT file and press Finish.

-------

This is the basic header information in the DAT file.  The company is BAMC, 
Cardiology Department, the data has been filtered at 250Hz with a gain of 4.  We see 
that the Start Date is Sept 23, 2004 at 12:15:06 in the morning. Now we know that's 
not the true study time because this data was originally captured on 1"tape.  This date
reflects the date and time at which the data was re-digitized and formatted for 
storage on disk.  Under other circumstances, the data would indeed reflect the study 
time during which the data was captured.

Press next. 

--------

These are the data fields available in the file.  We have Left Distal, Left Proxal,
Left Flow, Right Distal, Right Mid, Right Proxal, Right Fluid, Right Flow and an ECG.  
Today we are only going to be looking at Left Distal and Left Proxal values, and the ECG.

De-select the waveforms that are not of interest to us, and select Finish.

-------

When the progress bar at the bottom of the screen disappears, all the selected data
will have been loaded into the program.  We see a time line at the bottom, and an 
indicator showing us the location of our current view in the dataset.  From this 
timeline we can tell that we are viewing a 30 second window of data from a session  
that lasted about an hour.
 
We can drag this view indicator across the dataset until we locate an area
of interest.  One useful keyboard shortcut is the letter "C".  Press "C" to center 
the data on the current display.  Now we can see the pressure waveforms that we are
interested in as well as the ECG.  However, the ECG signal is on a different scale
and therefore should be displayed seperately. With the 
mouse over the graph, click the right mouse button and select "Split Display Band".
This creates a new graphics area at the top of the screen, and we can add the
 ECG signal to this new graph.

To do so, we can 
drag and drop the ECG signal label into the new graphics area.  The ECG signal has
now moved to the the top graph.  If we click the ECG label again it will be hilighted 
in red.
When a single signal is hilighted in red, this indicates that the signal is the 
"active" signal.  At most one signal can be active.  Some special operations apply
only to the active signal.  We can deactivate the signal with a single left click on the
signal label, the same way we activated the signal.  When the signal is deactivated 
all the signals return to their original colors.

Since splitting the display into two graphs, the signals in the lower graph are 
now off scale.  Move the mouse over this display area and press C again to center
the remaining signals in the resized graph. 

Now we see the expected data: ECG on the top, Left Heart pressures on the bottom.
-------

Navigation of the data can be done in several ways.
- You have already seen the effect of dragging the timeline indicator at the bottom
of the screen.
We can also use the "Arrow keys" and the "Mouse Wheel" to scroll to the left and scroll
to the right.  The "Arrow Keys" can also be used to move a graph either up or down.

Zooming can also be done in several ways.  First, the +and- keys zoom
in and out as expected.  A second method is to drag a rectangle with the mouse.
The hilighted area will become the new display area.

Calibration can be used for moving a single waveform relative to the other signals.
Calibration only affects the active signal.  Let's move the left distal press relative
to the other signals.  Click on the signal label to active the signal, and click on the
calibration icon at the top of the screen to enter calibration mode.  The background is
hilighted red to indicate that we are in calibration mode.

We can move L dist in small increments relative to the other signals using the arrow 
keys.  Click the calibration button again to exit calibration mode.

---------
Audio

In the lower right-hand corner, you will find a scale indicator that shows the width
of our viewing area in seconds, together with preset values for quick selection.
Lets select a 30-second window. 

This particular dataset also contains an audio
track with all of the relevent experiment information including signal calibration
and phases of the experiment.  Press the Play button to hear the audio 
track and see the experiment progress in realtime.

Press the Pause button to momentarily stop the replay.  At any time, the number 
key "0" can be pressed to reset the display to its starting position with a 30-second
window.

---------

Although we have not entered study events, or performed
any analysis, we will save our session using "File/Save".  This will assist in our
following tutorials for data analysis.

This concludes the basic introduction to tsOffline.
