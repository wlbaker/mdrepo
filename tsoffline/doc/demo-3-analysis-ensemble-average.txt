Hello, my name is Bill Baker.  Welcome to our continuation of tutorials on tsOffline, 
the analysis software developed at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research.

--

We are finally getting to the heart of this program: offline analysis. We will 
be continuing with the data set for Active Duty Normal soldiers from the 
Hemodynamic Waveform Library of the Cardiology Service at Brooke Army Medical Center.  

In our previous tutorial, we segmented the ECG and pressure waveforms using 
the peak of the R wave of the ECG as a fiducial marker.  If you are following
our videos, you can open that file from the recently opened list of files.  
Select File/BAMC 0049 tutorial 2.  

The first analysis script that we will examine will be used to generate the 
ensemble average of the Left Ventricular Pressure as well as other selected 
waveforms. The ensemble average, also known as a statistical ensemble, is a
probability distribution for the state of the system, which we will obtain
using a simple point-by-point average from a series of overlapping beats.

To obtain our ensemble average, we segment a continuous waveform into distinct
beats representing consecutive cardiac cycles over many respiratory periods.  Next,
beats are overlaid and aligned by our fiducial marker, which is the R-wave 
indicator.  Finally we take the average of the set of beats at each point in time.  
We shall use ensemble averaging to provide: 1) a waveform representative of the
patient’s hemodynamic status during the recording period 2) provided a measure of
respiratory variability and 3) demonstrate consequences of ectopy and other
aberrant events during the recording period.
 
# [NOTE:  Feature: 1) more representative of patient status (especially used in conjunction with 
# trend data) than snapshots of data,  2) QA data – to quickly define physiologic and non-physiologic 
# outliers, 3) novel way to assess respiratory variability for diagnoses and prognoses.],  
-----

First we need to select the time frame of interest for this analysis.  

For our purpose, we want to avoid large anomalies such as ectopic beats.
Pressing the key 'A' will zoom out to a display showing entire timeline.
The dense area of magenta are the R-wave indicators that we have previously 
generated.  Zoom in to the beginning of the data with R-wave indicators by
dragging a small rectangle over this area.  I am using a clean window 
I've selected a window between the time of 28:50 to 29:20.

-------

Lets look closely at the pressure waveforms by pressing the + key multiple times.
The Left Distal pressure comes from a sensor placed inside the left ventricle.
The Left Proximal pressure comes from a sensor in the aorta, slightly
outside the left ventricle.  During the heartbeat phase when the ventricle opens,
these pressures represent the force of cardiac contraction. When the heart valves
close, the Left Proxal (or aortic) pressure drops slowly, as the left distal
pressure drops dramatically as the heart chamber prepares to refill.

Scrolling through the data, the beat-to-beat pressure profile looks very uniform
at this scale.  Let's zoom back to approximately a 30-second interval using the "-"
key and center the pressure waveform.  At this scale, some respiratory induced
variation is visible in the pressure waveforms.  For patients breathing spontaneously,
thoracic and cardiac pressures will decrease during the inhalation.  For mechanically
ventilated patients, thoracic and cardiac pressures will be increased.   The
ventilatory changes in hemodynamics waveforms have clinical diagnostic and
prognostic significance.          

-------

To generate the ensemble average of the displayed data, Select Run/Analysis,
ensemble-average and Next.
We have three options for selecting the time range of our analysis.  We can
choose the interval visible in the display, specific event markers, or a
specific time range for the analysis.  For this analysis, the 30-second window
in the display will work well.  Select "Display" and click Next.

The first Ensemble Average that we wish to view is the Left Distal.  
Select "L dist" and Next.

-------

Our next screen shows the default script for generating the Ensemble Average.
For most of the analysis scripts, tsOffline uses R, which is a programming
language and software environment for graphics and statistical computing.
This allows the user with even minimal programming skills to alter existing
analysis scripts as well as derive new analysis scripts using a well-known
language and environment.  R is a useful tool which will already be familiar
to many researchers and most statisticians.

For the moment, we will accept the default script, and press Next generate the graph.

--------

The primary features of the Ensemble Average Graph are the gray lines which
represent the individual beats, the red line, which is the average at each
point in time of the individual beats, and the blue line, which indicates the
position of our R-wave fiducial point.  

Most of the data needed to reproduce this graph is shown in the graph itself.
We see the subject, 0049, at the top of the graph.  The subtitle at the bottom
of the graph indicates that this is an "Ensemble Average" graph of the "Left distal"
signal with 34 beats taken from a specific range of the dataset.  

The "lead time" for the waveform display  is -.15 sec, meaning that  our graph
starts slightly before the R-wave, and ends at the "lag time" of -.15 sec before
the subsequent R-wave.  

--------

Any continuously recorded waveform can be ensemble averaged.  Let's take another
look at the Ensemble Average, this time from the ECG signal.  Press "Previous" twice,
select ECG and press "Next" twice to recreate the graph.  This ensemble average does
not look ideal.  The vertical blue line is not necessary and possibly even distracting.
Also, the red dots might be big enough to obscure some of the more subtle features.
We can make two small changes to the script to improve the results we want.
Press "Previous". 

The last line of the script draws the vertical blue line that we wish to remove.
Delete this line.  The line above this draws the red points of the average.
Instead of the command "points", change the command to "lines", and press Next.

Now we can clearly distinguish the P, Q, R, S and T waves in the ensemble average,
even though these features were difficult to distinguish from any single ECG segment.
For periodic waveforms ensemble averaging reduces signal noise.   Press "Finish".

Now the plot has it's own independent window.  Resize the plot as desired.  Right
click on the plot and you will find options for copying the image or the data.  The
image can be pasted into any program that accepts graphic images, such as Word or
Powerpoint.  Data can be pasted directly into programs such as Excel.
Now close the graph window.

--------

We can easily build upon the ensemble average by graphing the beat-to-beat
variation in pressure over multiple respiratory phases.  To see the variances,
we can take the pressure waveform from each beat and subtract the ensemble average.
We have already included a script to do that which uses the standard Analysis commands.

Select Run/Analysis...ensemble average with variances.  We will again use the
display time range and the L-distal pressure.  Click Next.
We will accept the default script, and click Next.  Now we can clearly see
that the variation between beats is not uniform over the entire beat the
display is a novel way to express respiratory variability. This type of
display provides insight into parameters currently reported to guide fluid
therapy in patients in shock.    Press Cancel to close the graph without
opening a separate plot window.

We have also explored the potential the use of ensemble displays for representing
data acquired during dynamic procedures over a steady state period.  For example pulmonary
artery pressure can be displayed simultaneously with and with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
in critical care environments requiring flow directed right heart catheters. 
# [For this would need to trigger two ensemble average routines based on  EVENT markers.  
# Figure below would require two red lines one for PAP the other for PCWP and essentially 
# create an ensemble averaged Wiggers’ diagram ]

This concludes the ensemble average analysis tutorial.
