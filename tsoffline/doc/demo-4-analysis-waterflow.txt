Hello, my name is Bill Baker.  Welcome to our continuation of tutorials on tsOffline,
the analysis software developed at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research.

--------

In this demo, we will look at some classic waterfall diagrams of cardiac pressure 
signals.

We will be continuing our analysis of Active Duty Normal soldiers from the 
Hemodynamic Waveform Library of the Cardiology Service at Brooke Army Medical Center.  
If you are following our videos, you can open our data file from the recently opened
list of files.  Select File/BAMC 0049 tutorial 2.

----------

For this analysis, we will need to find a previously segmented data set
with thirty to fifty beats of ectopy free signal.
Press the letter A to see an overview of the entire dataset, and zoom in to
the area where R-waves begin.  We will use this as our starting point.

To begin the analysis, select Run/Analysis Waterfall, and next.  
Select the Displayed time frame, and press Next.

The Left Distal pressure measurement will be selected to demonstrate
Left Ventricular Pressures and press Next. The analysis script can be easily modified 
to adjust display features of the plot for research or clinical interest, 
but for now we will accept the default script.  And press Next.

The resulting image is a classic waterfall plot. Each wireframe profile represents a 
signal cardiac cycle.  28 consecutive beats are presented in this waterfall plot.  We
have chosen in our default script to begin the display of each beat 150 milliseconds
before the ECG R wave peak, which is our fiducial marker.

Although not drawn in this display, the fiducial
point is at time zero on the X-axis and also corresponds to
the moment in time of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  The
end of each cardiac cycle reflects the respiratory variability in this patient. 
Inspiration decreases ventricular pressures slightly and increases heart rate, thus
shortening the cardiac cycles. The influence of the respiratory cycle on cardiac
pressures will be more apparent later in this demo.

#Alter your script to change the angle of the display..  When display is shown..
# Note with this display angle, respiratory changes in left ventricular end-diastolic
# pressure can clearly be seen.

To illustrate the utility of the waterfall plots, we've taken two cases
 from different datasets which demonstrate phenomena difficult
to appreciate in standard time domain recordings.   

The first case is a waterfall plot of 100 consecutive Aortic Pressure
waveforms in a normal 35yo male showing late systolic peaking.  This
late systole is a reflected wave from the peripheral
vasculature and cannot be palpated during a physical exam.

In contrast, here is a second case that demonstrates the change
in the aortic pressure waveform as a catheter is passed from the
brachial artery to the aorta  in a young Active Duty patient with
a cardiac condition associated with sudden death called hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.  This diagram shows an initial rapid rise and peaking  of
systolic pressure with a secondary pulse becoming apparent as the 
catheter is advanced closer to the heart.

This secondary pulse can palpated as a double pulsation in the
carotid pulse, a finding known as a bifid pulse which has 
diagnostic significance.

In these overlapping images it can be difficult to clearly distinguish
some features and variations between beets.  To improve the graph, we can
use standard 3D visualization techniques to create a surface with
color and shading.  We call this variation a surface map.

-------

Press Previous until the list of available analyses appear, select
waterfall-contour and press Next.  Select the display time range, L dist pressures, and
press Next until the graph appears.

In this waterfall variation, we have both a 2D and 3D image.  A 2D contour
image is projected onto the Z axis plane above a 3D surface image which is 
is color hilighted for position and angle.
 
In this graph, moving along the Z axis from front to back, 
the respiratory variability can clearly be seen as a pressure variation between beets.

Along the X axis from left-to-right, rapid changes in ventricular pressure can be seen by both
changes in color within the three dimensional plot and by the proximity of the pressure
isobars in the contour map on the top of the display cube.  The rate of pressure
development within the heart is an index of contractility.  Similarly, the rate of fall
in pressure is an index of the relaxation properties of the hear.

Users may tweak the script to alter both color changes and distance 
between isobars.  Thus providing both quantitative and qualitative 
assessments of heart function.

In a similar manner, waterfall plots of the Aortic Pressure waveform, 
 may be used to assess the compliance of the systemic vasculature and
ventricular vascular coupling.  Press Previous twice, select L prox which is our
Aortic Pressure, and press Next twice.  In the contour plot, the onset of the dense 
isobars reflects the onset of blood ejection from the left ventricle and are followed
by a cluster of isobar lines at end systole indicate closure of the aortic valves. 

Contour plots of pressure waveforms may also be color coded as a novel way
to present the potential energy available during the cardiac cycle to propel blood
through the cardiovascular system.

This concludes our waterfall analysis tutorial.
