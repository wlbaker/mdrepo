Strategy:

Each PCamera is effectively a "band" of the display graph.  Each waveform display may consist 
of multiple bands, one above another.

Each signal is a layer in the "band".  The x coordinate of the signal is time (in seconds) relative 
to start of data collection.  The x-scale of every layer is 1.  The x-offset of every layer can be 
adjusted with calibration.

The y-offset and y-scale of the layer are determined exclusively by calibration.

The y-scale of the band camera can be adjusted by the user.

* reset scale in replay bar as size is changed
* fix center RANGE!
* filter type name not appearing
* save filter info for session
* export all!
* filter box graph has meaningless domain


19 Sept 16
	Fix the R-wave peak detector
	Export all signals to spreadsheet with Features/Annotations/Events/ etc.
	Ability to LEAD/LAG and identify the beat-id in an exported column
	Oscilloscope Pick oscilloscope view in the app¦maybe trend the color
	-- call it the beat-by-beat analysis screen¦precursor to ensemble average overlap graph
	[SORT BY CYCLE LENGTH]
	Fix +/-
	Fix file open error
	Second Band for ECG

* Fix export: timestamp misaligned between layers
* Fix import: recursive layers?
