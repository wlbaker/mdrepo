REGARDING jDAQmx
----------------

Appears the jDAQmx files overlap with Pista.  Not sure where this code should go.  
Currently compiled from Pista, so this overlapping copy may be old and obsolete.

PISTA is a prerequisite, but would be nice if it were optional....that would take
a better understanding of gradle organization.  This is supported in gradle, I just
haven't read/understood/incorporated/tested.

REGARDING GUI
-------------

I believe all these files have been moved to the meddaq code.  Confirm and remove,
or else figure out how to build features and variants.
