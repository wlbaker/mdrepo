You may need to add static routes for multicast, which can be
done through the DHCP server as follows:

subnet 10.21.25.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  option routers 10.21.25.1;

# Push static routes with ISC DHCP server to leases tables.
# Example below sets 10.21.25.0 255.255.255.0 10.21.25.1 10.21.25.x
# and 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.21.25.1 10.21.25.x
  option rfc3442-classless-static-routes 24, 10, 21, 25, 10, 21, 25, 1, 0, 10, 21, 25, 1;
  option ms-classless-static-routes 24, 10, 21, 25, 10, 21, 25, 1, 0, 10, 21, 25, 1;

Will produce:
	10.21.25.0 255.255.255.0 10.21.25.1 10.21.25.11 125
	10.21.25.11 255.255.255.255 On-link 10.21.25.11 380

[wlb]...so my best guess is the first byte is the netmask, followed by network or gateway...the question is how is the -net option handled?

  option ms-classless-static-routes 4, 224, 192, 168, 50, 1, 0, 10, 21, 25, 1;
  option classless-routes 4,224,192,168,50,0
[wlb]...trying to achive same routing as:
  sudo route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0

option classless-routes code 121 = array of unsigned integer 8;

subnet 10.23.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        [...]
        # Routes for 10.23.0.0/16 via 10.23.1.1, and 224.0.0.0/4 (all IP multicast) via same
        option classless-routes 16,10,23,10,23,1,1,4,224,10,23,1,1
        [...]
}
