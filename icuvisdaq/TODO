1- Gut PH
   * choose a signal source...could be drager, could be NI, could be phidget
   * choose a temperature source ... could be manual
   * CALIBRATE low PH
   * CALIBRATE high PH
   * Display panel with trends and calibration time
   * JFreeChart style
   
2- Harvard

- get INI parser for idea.conf ... put in IDEAServer
- class rewriting mixed w lombok to add JGoodies style binding

This should give us a pretty good idea of what the printing process can do.  If
you can send me 6 labels, I can subject them to a battery of adhesive tests.  

The size in the diagram is appx 1.5" x 3".  That is really a maximum size.  If you
need to go smaller for some reason, it will work for us.

Thank you.
