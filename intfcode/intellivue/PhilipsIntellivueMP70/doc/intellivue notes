Wave data (simultaneous access to 2 ECG and 5 other waves or 3 ECG and 2 other waves
depending on monitor and client configuration)

Up to three ECG waves (500 samples/s) can be polled simultaneously by selecting the appropriate
lead labels in the Wave object priority list. 

Up to eight non-ECG waves (125 or 62.5 samples/s) can be polled simultaneously by selecting the
appropriate labels in the Wave object priority list.

Entries in the Wave object priority list are ignored if the label does not exist or the object is not
available, or more than three ECG and/or more than eight non-ECG waves are specified


The wave context can be polled separately or multiplexed with the wave observed values. If the
polled_attr_grp is 0 in a periodic data poll request, the monitor reports one object’s static and
dynamic context per 1024 ms. Context attributes are included in the observation poll.
