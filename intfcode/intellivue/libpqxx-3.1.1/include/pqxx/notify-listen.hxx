/** @addtogroup notification Notifications and Listeners
 * To listen on a notification issued using the NOTIFY command, derive your own
 * class from notify_listener and define its function call operator to perform
 * whatever action you wish to take when the given notification arrives.  Then
 * create an object of that class and pass it to your connection.  DO NOT use
 * raw SQL to listen for notifications, or your attempts to listen won't be
 * resumed when a connection fails--and you'll have no way to notice.
 *
 * Notifications never arrive inside a backend transaction.  Therefore, unless
 * you may be using a nontransaction when a notification arrives, you are free
 * to open a transaction of your own inside your listener's function invocation
 * operator.
 *
 * Notifications you are listening for may arrive anywhere within libpqxx code,
 * but be aware that @b PostgreSQL @b defers @b notifications @b occurring
 * @b inside @b transactions.  (This was done for excellent reasons; just think
 * about what happens if the transaction where you happen to handle an incoming
 * notification is later rolled back for other reasons).  So if you're keeping a
 * transaction open, don't expect any of your listeners on the same connection
 * to be notified.
 *
 * Multiple listeners on the same connection may listen on a notification of the
 * same name.  An incoming notification is processed by invoking all listeners
 * (zero or more) of the same name.
