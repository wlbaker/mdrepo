<h1>Plugin architecture</h1><h4>HOW TO WRITE A BLOCK PLUGIN</h4>
<p>
A block plugin is used to save or read a specific, user defined block to a NTAR trace file.<p>
The philosophy behind these plugins makes use of a set of callbacks that should be exposed. The pointers to such callbacks are then registered to the core NTAR engine. Every plugin manages data written or read to/from a trace file in form of buffers of bytes of known size. The plugins are not required (and must not) access the underlying trace file descriptor directly.<p>
Every plugin is formed by at least three files (where xxx is the identifier of the plugin): <table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>plugin_xxx.c</td><td>It contains the actual code to read and write a block.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>plugin_xxx.h</td><td>It contains the public structures exposed to NTAR users. This include file is automatically available when <a class="el" href="ntar_8h.html">ntar.h</a> is included in a user application.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>plugin_xxx_int.h</td><td>It contains all the internal definitions used by the plugin (e.g. the prototypes of the functions defined by the plugin).  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Every plugin should export the following callbacks (again xxx stands for the identifier of the plugin):<br>
 <a class="el" href="group__PluginInterface.html">Block plugins callbacks</a> 
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td></td></tr>
</table>
