20050626 GV	Fix the hell of options writing.
20050626 GV	Work on the directory/marker block. 
20050626 GV	Marker block: http://www.winpcap.org/pipermail/ntar-workers/2005-June/000003.html
		Suppose we use sections to group packets: every section contains its own IDB.
		Sections are used to both group packets, and to support tracefile cat'ting. Can/should we distinguish these two approaches? How?
20050626 GV	We need a way to access files randomly (this is needed by ethereal, as well as by the directory/marker blocks).
20050626 GV	Ronnie suggested tools to offline "patch" files (e.g. patch pipe'd files, and rewrite the missing data, for example the SHB section length). To patch the SHB::length we can create a specific api for api for that. The problem is that the user has no access to the SHB informations 
		It seems useful, NTAR does not support mixed read/write of the files. We should basically add a function to rewrite block contents.
20050626 GV	Add some ntar_open option to enable disable seeks in the file. As I know, on win32 fsetpos and fgetpos are extremely slow!
20050626 GV	Deal with DLTs: at the moment ntar does not contain the definitions for the linktypes. We need to be very careful to avoid multiple
		definitions of the DLTs when the user include both pcap and ntar... maybe redefine DLTs as NTAR_DLT_xxx??

20050626 GV	Dealing with cyphered blocks: since now we have methods to read/write with external callbacks, we can cheat. Basically, get_block_dta on a cyphered block returns a sort of fake handle, that supports reads and writes. We can feed a new ntar instance with these handle and read/write functions. Problem: a cyphered block contains one or more blocks, no SHBs... We could cheat again creating a wrapping read function that returns a fake SHB when reading the beginning of the uncyphered content! Cool!
