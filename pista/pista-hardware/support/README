Routines needed by support include the following:

pista_set_named_field_freq
pista_set_named_field_spp
pista_dev_register_stream
pista_get_current_time_with_ms

dev_register_stream must call a function references by the PISTA context.
the "set_named_field" functions rely only on ProtobufC structures.
"get_current_time_with_ms" is a small operating system dependent function.
